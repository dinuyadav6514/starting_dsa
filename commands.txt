1. >> to EXECUTE a file in terminal :- 
                
                "g++ filename.cpp -o executable_filename.exe"


2. >> to run an executed/executable file :-
                
                ".\executablefile_name.exe"


3. Defining array :-
                int* arr = new int[n];  // Dynamically allocated array
                // Use it like a normal array
                delete[] arr;  // Don't forget to free memory

                vector<int> arr(n);  // Safer and easier to use
